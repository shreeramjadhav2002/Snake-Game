# Snake-Game
Players play as snake competing to collect food scattered across the board. Every time you eat the food, your snake grows longer. Watch out, though; if snake touches itself then the game will over, so a long snake is a tempting target! Points are awarded for eating foods.
In this Project, various concepts are included like Jframe, JPanel, ActionListener.
